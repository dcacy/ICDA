      Recognizing a Heart Attack or Angina
    </h1>
    <p dir="ltr">
      If you have risk factors for heart problems, you should always be on the lookout for signs of angina or a heart attack. If you have a sudden heart problem, getting treatment right away could save your life.

          Angina is a painful burning, tightness, or pressure in the chest, back, neck, throat, or jaw. It signals a lowered amount of blood flow to the heart, most commonly explained by a blockage in a heart artery. Angina is a sign that you may be having, or are about to have, a heart attack.

          A heart attack, also known as acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, is what happens when blood cannot get to part of the heart muscle. Part of the heart muscle then begins to die. A

    </ul>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      Stable angina versus unstable angina
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      Stable angina, also known as chronic angina, has a typical pattern. It occurs predictably with physical exertion or strong emotion. Symptoms are easily relieved by rest and nitroglycerin or both. Angina symptoms will most likely feel the same each time you have them. It is important to discuss these symptoms with your doctor, as they can be a warning sign for a future heart attack.
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
       
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
      Unstable angina causes unexpected or unpredictable symptoms, commonly occuring at rest, and is a medical emergency. Angina is also considered unstable if resting and nitroglycerin don't provide symptom relief or if symptoms are worsening, occuring more frequently, and lasting longer. These symptoms suggest a severe blockage or a spasm of a heart artery. Unstable angina is commonly a sign of an active heart attack. Remember the following tips:
    </p>
    <ul dir="ltr">
      <li>
        <p>
          Stable angina symptoms last for only a few minutes. If they last for longer than a few minutes, or go away and come back, you may be having a heart attack. Call 911!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Stable angina symptoms should go away with rest or medication. If they don't go away, call 911!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you have shortness of breath, cold sweat, nausea, or lightheadedness, call 911!
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p dir="ltr">
      For new-onset angina, there is only one response: ﻿call 911! You should never "diagnose" angina by yourself. If these symptoms are new, or worse than usual, call 911!
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      Warning signs of a heart attack
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      If you have symptoms that you can't explain, call 911 right away. The following are warning signs of a possible heart attack:
    </p>
    <ul dir="ltr">
      <li>
        <p>
          Chest discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back. It can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Discomfort in other areas of the upper body. Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Other signs may include breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea, or lightheadedness.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p dir="ltr">
      Note for women: Like men, women commonly have chest pain or discomfort as a heart attack symptom. But women are somewhat more likely than men to have other common symptoms, particularly shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, back pain, or jaw pain.

      Risk Factors for Heart Disease
    </h1>
    <p dir="ltr">
      A risk factor is something that increases your chance of having heart disease. Heart disease (also called coronary artery disease) involves damage to arteries, blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood through your body. Things like smoking or unhealthy cholesterol levels can damage arteries. You can't control some risk factors, such as age and a family history of heart disease. But most, including those listed below, are things you can control.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      <img alt="" src="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/images/heart.png" style="margin: 10px; float: left; width: 164px; height: 245px;" title="" />Unhealthy cholesterol levels
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      Cholesterol is a fatty substance in your blood. It can build up inside your arteries and block the blood flow to your heart or brain. Your risk of heart disease goes up if you have high levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol or triglycerides (another substance that can build up) You're also at risk if you don't have enough HDL cholesterol ("good") cholesterol that clears the bad cholesterol away.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      Smoking
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      This is the most important risk factor you can change. Smoking damages your arteries. It reduces blood flow to your heart and brain. It greatly increases your risk of heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and cancer. If you smoke, you are two to four times more likely to develop coronary artery disease.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      High blood pressure
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      High blood pressure occurs when blood pushes too hard against artery walls as it passes through the arteries. This damages the artery lining. High blood pressure raises your risk of heart attack, also known as acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, and especially stroke.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      Negative emotions
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      Stress, pent-up anger, and other negative emotions have been linked to heart disease. Over time, these emotions could raise your heart disease risk.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      Metabolic syndrome
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      This is caused by a combination of certain risk factors. It puts you at extra high risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. You have metabolic syndrome if you have three or more of the following: low HDL cholesterol; high triglycerides; high blood pressure; high blood sugar; extra weight around the waist.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      Diabetes
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      Diabetes occurs when you have high levels of sugar (glucose) in your blood. This can damage arteries if not kept under control. Having diabetes also makes you more likely to have a silent heart attack-one without any symptoms.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      Excess weight
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      Excess weight makes other risk factors, such as diabetes, more likely. Excess weight around the waist or stomach increases your heart disease risk the most.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      Lack of physical activity
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      When you're not active, you're more likely to develop diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, and excess weight.
    </p>

      Heart Failure: Being Active
    </h1>
    <p dir="ltr">
      You have a condition called heart failure (also known as congestive heart failure, or CHF). Being active doesn't mean that you have to wear yourself out. Even a little movement each day helps to strengthen your heart. If you can't get out to exercise, you can do simple stretching and strengthening exercises at home.

    </h2>
    <ul dir="ltr">
      <li>
        <p>
          Add a little movement to things you do now. Walk to mail letters. Park your car at the far end of the parking lot and walk to the store.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Choose activities you enjoy. You might walk, swim, or ride an exercise bike. Things like gardening and washing the car count, too.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Join a group exercise program at a YMCA or YWCA, a senior center, or a community center. Or look into a hospital cardiac rehabilitation program.

      <li>
        <p>
          Get up and get dressed each day. You'll feel more like being active.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make a plan. Choose one or more activities that you enjoy and that you can easily do. Then plan to do at least one each day. You might write your plan on a calendar.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Go with a friend or a group if you like company. This can help you stay motivated, too.

                     <title>When Your Child Has a Heart Murmur</title>
                     <content><![CDATA[<h1 dir="ltr">
      When Your Child Has a Heart Murmur
    </h1>
    <p dir="ltr">
      The heart makes sounds as it beats. These sounds occur as the heart valves open and close to allow blood to flow through the heart. A <b>heart murmur</b> is an extra noise. The noise is caused by the blood not flowing smoothly through the heart. This is called turbulence. Heart murmurs can be <b>innocent</b> (harmless) or <b>pathologic</b> (caused by a heart problem).
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      What Causes a Heart Murmur?
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      An innocent heart murmur is caused by mild turbulence in blood flow within the heart. A pathologic heart murmur is often caused by a structural heart defect. This can include:<img alt="" src="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/images/childheart.JPG" style="margin: 10px; float: right; width: 243px; height: 163px;" title="" />
    </p>
    <ul dir="ltr">
      <li>
        <p>
          Septal defects (holes in the dividing walls of the heart that allow blood to pass through)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heart valve problems (valve has trouble opening or closing)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Artery-vein fistulas (abnormal connections between a blood vessel on the left side of the heart and a blood vessel on the right side of the heart)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      What Are the Symptoms of a Heart Murmur?
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      Innocent heart murmurs cause no symptoms. Symptoms related to a pathologic heart murmur depend on the underlying cause of the murmur.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      How Is a Heart Murmur Diagnosed?
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      The doctor or health care provider may detect a heart murmur during a physical exam. Heart noises are heard with a stethoscope. A heart murmur is classified by how loud it is, its location, when it occurs during the heart's pumping cycle, and its sound qualities. If the doctor suspects the murmur is pathologic, your child may be referred to a <b>pediatric cardiologist.</b> This is a doctor who diagnoses and treats heart problems in children. The following tests may be done:
    </p>
    <ul dir="ltr">
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Chest X-ray.</b> This test takes a picture of the heart and lungs. The picture can show your child's heart size and shape. It can show some problems that may occur in the heart or lungs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).</b> During this test, the electrical activity of the heart is recorded to check for arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) or problems with heart structure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Echocardiogram (echo).</b> During this test, sound waves are used to create a picture of the heart. This test can show problems with heart structure or heart function. This includes showing how well the heart pumps, if the heart is enlarged, or if there are any valve problems.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      How Is a Heart Murmur Treated?
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      An innocent heart murmur requires no treatment because it's not caused by a heart problem. Treatment for a pathologic murmur depends on the underlying cause. The cardiologist will evaluate your child's condition and discuss treatment options with you if needed.
    </p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">
      What Are the Long-term Concerns?
    </h2>
    <p dir="ltr">
      Most innocent murmurs usually go away by the time children become adolescents or young adults. A murmur may also become louder or more noticeable, or even return if no longer present, if a child has a fever or another cause of a fast heart rate. If pathologic heart murmurs aren't diagnosed or treated, severe symptoms may result and cause serious health problems. These can include heart failure, arrhythmias, or respiratory problems.
