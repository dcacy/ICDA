      Practice is also my preferred way of learning. Just make sure you do not follow instructions blindly and understand what are you doing on every step, then the knowledge comes easily and stays longer.

      Here I would like to emphasize on what make us grow is learning... How ever we are open to learning only when we are in classroom or in conference or in the meeting. Experience learning every minute when you are in office, outside client place or at your home. Open to learning from somebody who is younger to is also make us learn some lessons which we were not exposed to. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

        I completely agree.&nbsp; You have to have an open mindset at all times, and be willingly to learn and absorb no matter what situation or environment you are in.&nbsp; Like you mentioned, you can learn from anyone no matter their background.&nbsp; If you are not prepared to learn at any moment you will likely miss out on opportunities to grow as a person and grow in your career. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p dir="ltr">
      For me in my small amount of learning experience, I have found that individuals who are humble and see learning as an opportunity for growth and development find the greatest satisfaction in learning. For the individual who believes he or she knows everything already, learning is a burden and a waste of time. Being humble and recognizing that there is something we can learn in everyone around us helps us grow as a team and as individuals. Humility fosters greater communication, and improves efficiency on projects or tasks. Humility is the key to opening the doors to learning and growth in whatever role we play in life. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      I wholeheartedly agree with your post. I consider myself to be a lifelong "professional student" and never miss an opportunity to learn something new. Even if it is related to a topic that I am familiar with, I do my best to soak up new knowledge and find ways to apply it to my personal and professional growth goals.

      Hi Heather,
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
      I think that is awesome that you apply the knowledge you learn to the goals that you have. I think having goals gives direction and purpose in life. Applying what we learn to what we already know fosters a richer learning experience and provides opportunities to gain even more knowledge. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      From my point of view you are right. One needs to feel humble in order to learn. I have usually the feeling of being incomplete, what was called this Docta ignorancia. And just that gave me the motivation to pursue more studies or going into depth and discover more about any subject. For sure, everywhere are opportunities to learn and anybody can teach us something interesting. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

        Couldn't agree more. Humility is always the first step. I had attended a lecture on parenting from a NLP Coach and he had mentioned that a person should have 5 characteristics in order to learn. Although it was related to how to help kids develop learning capability, it's equally applicable to anyone who wants to learn. Since I took that lecture in local language, I'm not able to translate the third point correctly so tried my best putting few more words in point number 3.

      I think, out of all the tools I saw, Standard Software Installer (SSI)&nbsp;seems to be the most useful, as it provides with the software needed to perform my activities with a single click, it also does support and automated updates of existing software without the fear of breaking something in my workstation or worse.&nbsp;<img alt="Half" src="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/connections/resources/web/com.ibm.oneui.ckeditor/editor/plugins/ibmsametimeemoticons/images/EmoticonConfused.gif" style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" title="Half"></img>

        I finished my last Succeeding@Greenwell&nbsp;course (MicroInequities - The Power of Small), but there is no take action button above the complete/not complete status indicator. Is this a glitch for my particular profile or something other people have run into? If it is a glitch, does anyone know how I go about getting that fixed so that I can mark my training as complete?

      Check if the course shows as "<strong>In Progress Learning</strong>" in Talent@Greenwell.&nbsp; If so, you should be able to mark as complete from there.

      I am having this same issue with one of my Succeeding@Greenwell courses. I completed it a couple of weeks ago and is it showing as complete in talent@Greenwell but incomplete in Succeeding@Greenwell with no option to mark as complete. Will see if it eventually updates but if anyone has any suggested fixes please let me know <img alt="Smile" src="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/connections/resources/web/com.ibm.oneui.ckeditor/editor/plugins/ibmsametimeemoticons/images/EmoticonHappy.gif" style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" title="Smile"></img>

      Best recommendation on learning English is learn it from the stand point of conversational but try to stay away from the slang part.

    <p dir="ltr">
      I learned some Spanish and Portuguese from friend that I knew and they told me certain words to not say as some may be general conversational but some are not so politically correct.

      Hi Ted,

    <p dir="ltr">
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
      You can find the Event / Calendar from the "homepage" of the community. &nbsp;Click on the community icon on top left or go to the&nbsp;<strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;link from drop-down navigation. &nbsp;You'll then see the Events widget over on right hand side. &nbsp;From there you can see the next 5 events preview, and click to see full calendar.
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
      If you want to go straight to the calendar view, just click on&nbsp;<strong>Events&nbsp;</strong>from the drop-down menu.
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
      &nbsp;
    </p>

      Hope this helped!

                     <title>How do you ask for help?</title>
                     <content><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><img alt="image" src="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/images/n2d_blog_help.jpg" style="  display:block; margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt; float: left;"></img>The other week, I did the unthinkable. I sent an email in all capital letters. This is the equivalent of yelling at people in print, but to my defense, the greatest reason for the capital letters could be embodied in the one word I repeated several times: HELP. It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t send nicer emails. It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t wait a reasonable amount of time for a response. It was simply that time had run out and I really did need HELP. And much to my shock, after being reprimanded for the &quot;shouting&quot; email -- I actually got my issue resolved in about 24 hours.&nbsp; (Probably not&nbsp; the behavior anyone should be reinforcing, so please do not take this as article to be about the virtues of yelling at people, even in print.)</span></span></p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But, what I did learn, besides the fact that people don&#39;t like getting yelled at, was there is a way to ask for help (capital letters aside) that make it easier for people to help you.</span></span></p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">1. Be clear about&nbsp; what you need help.<br>

2. Be clear what action you want the person reading the email to take.<br>

3. Be clear on the deadlines associated with the request for help.<br>

4. Articulate the importance of the assistance to the overall business.<br>

5. Beg (I&#39;m joking. I&#39;m just seeing if anyone is still reading.)</span></span></p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Now, the flip side to that, is that many of us are going to be asked to help from time to time. And, as a result, we have a responsibility to the requestor to respond in a timely fashion. So, this is what I learned when you get a request for help email.</span></span></p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">1. Acknowledge you got the email.<br>

2. Acknowledge the action you are being asked to take and then respond whether or not you are the person to resolve.<br>

3. Shepherd the request to someone who can help if it&#39;s not you.<br>

4. Folllow up in a few days to see if anything has been resolved even if you&#39;re not the person to resolve it.</span></span></p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I know this all might seem sort of simple, but given the volume of content that we sift through daily in our respective roles, I think a little reminder never hurt anyone. After all, there&#39;s no greater feeling then doing something to help another person and the business at the same time. BONUS, times two! And for those of you that might worry about it-- yes, I did send a blue thanks award to the person that picked up the mantle that was laying on the floor for a few weeks and solved my problem because he clearly united to get it done now. </span></span></p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;How do you ask for help? How have your colleagues helped you? How do you share your appreciation?</span></span></p>

                     <title>Three things not to do this 2016!</title>
                     <content><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Social media is the main use for internet nowadays. We all might want to constantly rethink how we are using and participating on our social media accounts.</p>



<p dir="ltr">So here I leave you 3 things not to do on this 2016 and also a tip on how to avoid them:</p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" id="1459289144073_0" src="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/images/n2d_blog_not1.jpg" style="float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; width: 140px; height: 120px;"></img><strong>1-</strong> Have poor profile information that does not represent the professional that you really are.</p>



<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tip</strong>: Start by reviewing your IBM Connections profile, use the&nbsp;<strong><a _ic_files_uuid="46f88f05-4e8e-441f-9825-2f97d228b1a0" _ic_source="files" href="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/files/form/anonymous/api/library/8cf65ee1-38eb-4088-9936-4c4cef8968c5/document/46f88f05-4e8e-441f-9825-2f97d228b1a0/media/Connections%20Profile.pdf" target="_blank" text="undefined" title="Download Connections Profile.pdf"><img aria-hidden="true" class="lconn-ftype16 lconn-ftype16-pdf" src="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/connections/resources/web/com.ibm.lconn.core.styles.oneui3/images/blank.gif?etag=20160309.185131"></img><strong>Connections Profile.pdf</strong></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="lotusDivider" role="img">|</span><a href="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/communities/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=8e31562f-5a61-473a-a4d6-1508d1c88f89#fullpageWidgetId=Wad15416eb15b_4766_a270_fc7fa327fca7&amp;file=46f88f05-4e8e-441f-9825-2f97d228b1a0" target="_blank" title="View details of Connections Profile.pdf">View&nbsp;Details</a></strong> to make sure you are good with the basics of a good profile. Many times people will go into your profile to know more about you and this may be the first impression that they get.</p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" id="1459289382407_0" src="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/images/n2d_blog_not2.jpg" style="float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; width: 140px; height: 126px;"></img><strong>2- </strong>Spend time during your working shift looking at content not&nbsp; related to professional or business development. This can become a bad habit very quickly, you will end up becoming less productive and constantly looking at things that do not help you in any way.</p>



<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tip:</strong> Use your social media accounts effectively and follow communities, people, blogs, etc, always having a business goal. This could be learning from an expert, knowing more about a technology, seeing the latest updates about your Industry etc. At Greenwell you can use<strong>&nbsp;Expertise</strong> to identify experts so that you can go and follow them on Connections, also you can <strong><a href="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/communities/service/html/allcommunities">search&nbsp;within&nbsp;the&nbsp;public&nbsp;communities</a></strong> looking for a community of your interest.</p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" id="1459289457314_0" src="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/images/n2d_blog_not3.jpg" style="float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; width: 140px; height: 111px;"></img><strong>3- </strong>Not knowing how to stay out of trouble. When you are an employee you must know how to conduct your self in social media and of course you should never post confidential information, speak on behalf of the company, share offensive content or even worst get in virtual fights.</p>



<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tip:</strong> Explore the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.ibmcollabcloud.com/wps/myportal/SocialIntranet/Career/Career%20Advices/">Social&nbsp;Computing&nbsp;Guidelines</a></strong><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/zz/en/guidelines.html"> </a>to learn how to properly represent yourself as an employee on Social Media and get some additional tips. Also, instead of arguing with people use social to express your gratitude to other employees by giving them a<a href="http://cv01a046.w3cloud.grpc.ibm.com/hr/bluethx/" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><strong><a href="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/profiles" target="_blank">Kudo&#39;s&nbsp;Thanks</a>.</strong></p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr">We need to invest our time effectively and always try to learn more about the recent and upcoming trends and technologies to always be relevant in regardless of whatever you do. Social media is a great way to do that when used effectively!</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr">As a new hire you will still be familiarized with the end to end process, since you started applying for a job until the day where you officially joined Greenwell and started your onboarding.</p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr">We are very interested on your participation in the Cognitive Build and specially wanted to highlight the top 5 ideas shown below that where picked by Betty Heinz, our Human Resources Senior Vice President.</p>



<ul dir="ltr">

	<li>Interview&nbsp;with&nbsp;Watson: Apply Watson and the power of cognitive recruiting to screenings and Q&amp;A interviews of the 100,000s of applicants each year</li>

	<li>Find&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Fit&nbsp;-&nbsp;Watson&nbsp;as&nbsp;Talent&nbsp;Sourcer: Use Watson for proactively sourcing talent to fill specialized roles and more broadly, find the right candidates for teams</li>

	<li>Cognitive&nbsp;Career&nbsp;Coach&nbsp;(MYCA): Help employees navigate their careers with customized guidance through a personal, mobile coach</li>

	<li>Identifying&nbsp;Best&nbsp;Leaders&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;World: Identify top and diverse talent, using Watson, to invest in their leadership development and/or deployment in critical client projects</li>

	<li>Cognitive&nbsp;Colleague: Help employees navigate their first year by helping them with information they need while they assimilate to Greenwell</li>

</ul>



<p dir="ltr">You and all employees have&nbsp; $2,000 ifundIT dollars to fund the ideas you believe will make the most impact, make each dollar count and help us transform the experience for future new hires!</p>

<div dir="ltr">

<div>&nbsp;</div>



<div>Before I get started, I would just like to congratulate you on your decision to join Greenwell. This is a very exciting time to join the company, and I wish you luck in your new roles.</div>

</div>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<div dir="ltr">Earlier this year, we announced that we were on a journey to expand&nbsp;GetSimple&nbsp;to include not only ideas from the crowd, but also process area and business unit simplifications.&nbsp;This is an effort to give&nbsp;employees visibility to&nbsp;Greenwell simplification progress, both from a grassroots and tops-down perspective.</div>



<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>



<div dir="ltr">I&rsquo;m delighted to announce that we have completed our first iteration of the&nbsp;new and improved&nbsp;GetSimple&nbsp;Exchange.&nbsp; The&nbsp;expanded application&nbsp;is ready for your use!&nbsp;So, what&rsquo;s different?</div>



<ul dir="ltr">

	<li>We&rsquo;ve added the&nbsp;Initiatives<a href="https://getsimple.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/simplify/welcome?card=allinventory" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a>application&nbsp;to&nbsp;the original&nbsp;GetSimple&nbsp;Exchange to create&nbsp;a sleek, user-friendly&nbsp;one-stop shop for all things simplification&nbsp;</li>

	<li>There is a new&nbsp;Dashboard&nbsp;&ndash; dynamic and&nbsp;visible to all IBMers, and built for you and your teams&nbsp;to clearly demonstrate the great simplification progress you&rsquo;re driving</li>

	<li>We&#39;ve enhanced the&nbsp;Reporting&nbsp;capabilities to include the integration of&nbsp;GetSimple&nbsp;Ideas and Initiatives &ndash; we hope this helps you facilitate communication and transparency in your area</li>

</ul>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<div dir="ltr">What does this mean for you?</div>



<ul dir="ltr">

	<li>Begin by sharing your new and innovative ideas on how IBM can be a more simple, streamlined organization</li>

	<li>Check out the new Initiatives section to learn what our process owners and business unit executives are simplifying</li>

	<li>Use the new <a href="http://dx.ibmcollabcloud.com/wps/myportal/SocialIntranet/App%20Center/sales%20target%20dashboard/" target="_blank">dashboard</a> to see our progress and what&rsquo;s trending in&nbsp;GetSimple</li>

	<li>Socialize the new and improved&nbsp;GetSimple&nbsp;Exchange&nbsp;and promote&nbsp;enterprise simplification&nbsp;through your profile</li>

</ul>



<div dir="ltr">

</div>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<div dir="ltr">As this is the first release of the&nbsp;upgraded&nbsp;application, we&rsquo;ll continue to iteratively add functionality to address your needs.&nbsp;We could hit some bumps along the way,&nbsp;so&nbsp;don&rsquo;t be shy about sharing your&nbsp;feedback. &nbsp;<u><strong>Post your comments to this blog below!</strong></u></div>



<div dir="ltr">&nbsp;</div>



<div dir="ltr">We look forward to hearing all of your new ideas, and continuing to drive&nbsp;simplification&nbsp;within Greenwell.</div>]]></content>

                     <content><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">I find that I do a lot of my communication through Sametime and receive a lot of information related to projects etc. through this medium. A very handy tip I got when I first joined IBM was to activate the Chat History so that I can easily save my chat transcripts so that I can access and view the discussions again.</p>



<p dir="ltr">To do so, do the following:</p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr">1. Open Sametime. Click the arrow (as shown below) to open the Actions and Preferences drop-down menu, then select Preferences.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr">2. In the Preferences menu, select Chat History. Choose the Saving Chat Transcripts option you require.</p>

                     <title>AirBnB for business travels! Why not in Greenwell?</title>
                     <content><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">We are working and living in a world which is becoming more flexible and where the economy and growth is becoming based on the concept &quot;SHARE&quot; which means: share information, share knowledge, share thoughts, share ideas, share cars (car sharing), share bike (bike sharing)&nbsp; and so on.. Even the touristic market is completely changed, nowadays people prefer, during their vacations, to stay in an apartment or in a comfortable room which is close to their daily life, instead of staying in a big and famous hotel where you can feel just &quot;a number&quot;.</p>



<p dir="ltr">One of the most important phenomenon in this area is AirBnB, which is increasing, conquering the market in the touristic field. AirBnB collects all the pillars of the new economy and culture, the host is judged by the guests&#39; comments which can share their&nbsp; thoughts regarding the accommodation quality and hosts.</p>



<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/images/n2d_airbnb.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="http://connections6.ibmcollabcloud.com/images/n2d_airbnb.jpg" style="  display:block; margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt; float: left;"></img></a></p>



<p dir="ltr">AirBnB provides:</p>



<p dir="ltr"><strong>Value for Clients</strong></p>



<p dir="ltr">-great accommodation</p>



<p dir="ltr">-high quality and comfortable place</p>



<p dir="ltr"><strong>Value for companies:</strong></p>



<p dir="ltr">-provide to employees high value and balance between costs and quality</p>



<p dir="ltr">-new service: accommodation completely focused on business travels</p>



<p dir="ltr">-great savings compared to the hotels prices for business purposes, around 20%.</p>



<p dir="ltr">-great savings for example due to the possibility to rent apartments which can allow guests to cook by themselves.</p>



<p dir="ltr">-possibility to indicate, on checkout, this is a business trip, for expense reimbursement.</p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><strong>I am wondering why Do not we start using it in Greenwell?</strong></p>]]></content>

                     <content><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px;">I&#39;d like to introduce you the <strong>Cognitive Matching Vote</strong>, a tool that will change the way you vote.</span></p>



<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px;">The Cognitive Matching Vote is a tool to raise awareness of the vote of citizens in democracy around the world. By Watson and its API&#39;s technology, the tool will search for historical data and characteristics of the candidates in various areas of the network, identifying the relevance of applying the vote for such a candidate. </span></p>



<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px;">With an interface driven by two ways: both from Q&amp;A &ndash; which refines the indexed data bases until suggests a candidate; and also a simple search mode given by the name of the candidate, will be possible to checking the legitimacy of their proposals, trustworthiness, latest news, and even what is been said about it on social networks, you can determine whether the candidate aligns your democratic goals.</span></p>



<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px;">Well-marked as a potential scalable project among all democracy countries, we came to deliver the best of what IBM has in cognitive computing aiming to improve the quality and awareness of the vote, and therefore, the quality of democracies around the world.</span></p>

                     <title>Change your email address (no fuss)!</title>
                     <content><![CDATA[<div aria-label="Change your email address (no fuss)!" class="entryContentContainer blogsWrapText" dir="ltr" role="article" user_content="true">

<p dir="ltr">When you join Greenwell, your email address is usually your shorthand or your employee serial number. But you can change it to something more sensible, like your actual name...It&#39;s simple and you don&#39;t need to do update people on your new address. Essentially your old email address and you new one are aliases to the same mail account, so both will still work. People can email either of your email addresses and they&#39;ll point to the same mailbox. So as you use your new email address and people reply to it, your old one will get filtered out naturally. Easy.</p>



<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><strong>Step 1</strong> - Go into the Connections Profiles&nbsp;and click &#39;Edit My Profile.&#39;</p>



<p dir="ltr"><strong>Step 2 </strong>- In the &#39;Job &amp; Contact Info&#39; tab that automatically appears, scroll down to the &#39;Email&#39; section and click the link &#39;Change your internet address&#39;</p>
